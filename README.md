# CTFs
A repository to store my documentation for CTF write ups, tools and scripts I have used to develop my CTF skills.

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my methodology used within specific CTF style labs. I am using it both to track my personal progress in developing my pentesting skills as well as showcasing these to a public audience. The goal is to use this repo as a guide for future labs where I will have instant access to commonly used scripts or reference write ups from labs similar to the one I am busy with to brainstorm ways of attacking the target.
